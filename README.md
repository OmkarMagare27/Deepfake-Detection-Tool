# Deepfake-Detection-Tool

# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time deepfake detection tool using deep learning techniques. The goal is to differentiate between AI-generated deepfake images and real ones to ensure the integrity of digital content. With the rise of deepfake technology, this tool is crucial for identifying manipulated media and preventing the spread of misinformation.

The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process and classify images. The model is trained on a large dataset of real and deepfake images to ensure high accuracy and robustness.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains both real and manipulated images. The deepfake images are generated using AI techniques, primarily face-swapping, which is a common form of deepfake creation. The dataset is balanced with an equal number of real and manipulated images to train the model effectively.

# Project Goals
Real-Time Deepfake Detection: Build a model that can detect deepfake images in real-time with high accuracy.
Model Development: Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images as either real or manipulated.
Data Augmentation: Apply techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve model robustness.
Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras
Image Processing: OpenCV
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Model Architecture
The core of the tool is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks as they are capable of learning spatial hierarchies in images.

Key Layers in the Model:
Convolutional layers for feature extraction
Batch normalization to stabilize learning
Global average pooling to reduce dimensionality
Fully connected layers for classification

# Results
Accuracy: The model achieved 95% accuracy in classifying images as real or manipulated.
Performance: The model was able to process images in real-time, making it suitable for live applications in media verification.
